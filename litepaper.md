KoinFix: a Web3 P2P Crypto Exchange to Solve DeFi's Fiat On/Off-Ramp Challenge

## Summary/Introduction

## Problem

- Notable challenges and limitations of existing protocols
Facts and figures that explain the depth of the pain-point

## Solution

## Mission

## How it Works (with detail)

- screenshots
- failure modes and stress tests? risk assessment
- terms and conditions?

## Use Cases (why and why no)

## Tokenomics

The initial distribution, vesting schedules, the token’s utility and specific sinks/sources in the system. the token's purpose in the protocol, what it allows users to do, who can hold the token, and the number of tokens in circulation over time.

Draft concept:
- 50% makers
- 25% team
- 25% DAO (swap program comes from here, max 12 million swapped, time limit, maybe 1 month
- 240 million total supply

### Token supply

### Token utility 

### Token distribution

### Token burns

### Incentive mechanisms 

- where will we provide token liquidity
- illustrate key roles the community play in the protocol (e.g. validators, governance, submit improvement proposals, etc) and be thoughtful about discussing the role of the core team.
